# Gold Splits #

Gold Splits is a platform for speedrunners of various games to gather together to discuss various topics. Post your new personal best times, start a discussion about strategies or create a guide on a route.

This platform will provide user's with a forum where they can:
- Post their own content including images and videos
- Read and like other users' posts
- Comment on other users' posts

The platform will also allow admins of the site to moderate and remove any inappropriate content and user's.

This project will use the Django framework for a MVC based application using Postgres databases to manage information.
